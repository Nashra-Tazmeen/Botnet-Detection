# Botnet-Detection
**Project Title:**  ML approach for Botnet detection in IoT

**Project Overview:**  As we know security remained one of the top research areas in networking whether it is based on cloud computing or fog computing. Several researchers are focusing on detecting botnet attacks.
	
  Here in this project, I have generated a botnet detection Ml model employing a sophisticated algorithm leveraging features and analysis through supervising learning techniques enabling it to identify potential Botnets with high accuracy.
  
Key components of the project includes:

 - Data Loading
 - preprocessing
 - Model definition
 - Training
 - Prediction
 - Evaluation
