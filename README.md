# Botnet-Detection
**Project Title:**  ML approach for Botnet detection in IoT

**Project Overview:**  As we know security remained one of the top research areas in networking whether it is based on cloud computing or fog computing. Several researchers are focusing on detecting botnet attacks.
	
  Here in this project, I have generated a botnet detection Ml model employing a sophisticated algorithm leveraging features and analysis through supervised learning techniques enabling it to identify potential Botnets with high accuracy.
  
Key components of the project includes:

 - Data Loading
 - preprocessing
 - Model definition
 - Training
 - Prediction
 - Evaluation


Conclusion:
In this botnet detection project, employing Random Forest and Logistic Regression models has proven effective. The choice of AUC and ROC curve as evaluation metrics indicates a focus on model performance across various thresholds. The ensemble nature of Random Forest contributes to robustness, while Logistic Regression offers interpretability. Regularly updating and fine-tuning these models will ensure adaptability to emerging botnet patterns. The integration of these models into security workflows, along with ethical considerations, underscores a comprehensive approach to effective and responsible botnet detection.
